# Web site submission
## Large Coursework Brief
* Your brief is to design and build a responsive website of a magazine or a newsletter. This may take the form of a topical or a news magazine or a newsletter for a club or society. If possible this should represent a real situation. For example:

* A topical magazine should be of interest to people who follow that topic, so find a group of enthusiasts about a topic that would like a magazine.

* Find a club that needs a newsletter and try to understand what that might cover and look like.

* Be careful ... make it clear that you are interested to prototype a web site for a student project, and perhaps later show them what might be possible. Donâ€™t promise to build them a web site for this assignment. If you want to negotiate to do that in your own time as an individual feel free to do that.

* Your web site should have 5 pages with different types of news and articles. Wherever possible sample content should be representative of the material for that web site. It should have appropriate media, including video and sound clips if relevant.

* In addition to the web site, you will include a report.html file with associated images etc. in your site's base directory. This will explain what you have learned in the process of building your site, where you found your information, and how you have adapted any resources (if applicable). The outline template for the report can be found here:

* The specific items you should include in the report are shown in the report template and listed in the Design and Reflection review criteria.

## Review Criteria
* The project can be described as a set of basic and a set of advanced requirements. They are as follows

### Basic Requirements
* Your site directory will be well organised and files given suitable names
* Your site should validate to HTML5 web standards
* Your CSS should meet CSS3 standards and degrade gracefully on older browsers
* CSS should be in separate stylesheets (not embedded in HTML)
* Your site should be responsive. You can use a framework such as Bootstrap to help you to achieve this, but it you should also include responsive CSS code that is your own work
* Your site should be easy to use and navigate
* Your site should be aesthetically appealing with suitable fonts and colour scheme
* Your site should be accessible, with semantically correct HTML
* Your site should make use of unobtrusive JS where appropriate
* Your JS will be in script tags or separate files (no inline JS)

### Advanced features
* Advanced CSS (i.e. animations and/or transitions, comprehensive @media queries)
* Custom JS (i.e. code you've written yourself)
* Breadcrumbs
* Dynamic content/JS templates
